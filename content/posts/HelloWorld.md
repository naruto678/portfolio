## Introduction 

Hello, World!. This is **Arnab Thakuria**. Here i plan to write about 
- **Programming** 
- Books that I am currently reading or have read. Call it synopsis of some sorts
- Random ramblings 
- Distributed systems 
- Some stuff related to compilers 
- And some stuff related to golang/rust/java

 The site is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and uses an [ezhil](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/hugo-ezhil/) theme *dark-mode* . I like vim and everything about the terminal . And if you are wondering about this cool font ... drumroll... it's  [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans). I use it for everything. Give it a try . It will improve  your development workflow . But enough about the font, 
 
You can follow me on [github](https://github.com/naruto678) or send me a hi on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnab-thakuria-641918143/)

And lastly **Happy new Year 2023** . Created this site as some sort of new year resolution ðŸ˜‚. I hope this is a productive year for everyone .
